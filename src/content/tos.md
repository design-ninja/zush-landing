Welcome to Zush. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Zush application for macOS ("Service"), provided by Kirill Isachenko ("we," "us," or "our"). By downloading, installing, or using Zush, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

### 1. Description of Service
Zush is a macOS utility designed to help users organize, rename, and manage metadata for image files using artificial intelligence (AI). Features include automatic renaming, smart metadata tagging (Finder tags and Spotlight comments), and folder monitoring.

### 2. Software License
We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to use Zush on macOS devices that you own or control, subject to these Terms.

### 3. Purchases and Payments
**3.1 🌟 PRO Version**
Zush offers a "🌟 PRO" one-time purchase that provides increased monthly AI rename limits (currently 5,000 renames/month), monitoring of multiple folders, and advanced metadata features. The current price is displayed within the application and on the website.

**3.2 One-Time Purchase Terms**
The 🌟 PRO license is a one-time purchase, not a subscription. This grants you access to PRO features for the current major version of the application. We may release future major versions with new features that require a separate purchase. Minor updates and bug fixes for the purchased version are provided at our discretion with no guaranteed support period.

**3.3 Usage Limits**
Both free and PRO versions have monthly usage limits for AI-powered features. These limits reset each calendar month. Current limits are displayed in the application.

**3.4 Merchant of Record**
Our order process is conducted by our online reseller Paddle.com. Paddle.com is the Merchant of Record for all our orders. Paddle provides all customer service inquiries and handles returns.

**3.5 Refunds**
Refund requests are handled by Paddle in accordance with their refund policy.

### 4. AI-Powered Features and Accuracy
Zush uses artificial intelligence to analyze files and generate suggestions for names and metadata.
- User Responsibility: Since AI can occasionally produce incorrect or unexpected results, you are responsible for reviewing and verifying any changes made by the Service to your files.
- No Warranty: We do not guarantee the absolute accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any information generated by the AI features.

### 5. Usage Limits and Fair Use
The free version of Zush may include usage limits (e.g., a limited number of AI-processed images per month). We reserve the right to monitor usage and suspend accounts that attempt to bypass these limits or engage in abusive behavior.

- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the application.
- Use the Service for any illegal purpose.
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our backend services or licensing systems.

### 8. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, KIRILL ISACHENKO SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA (INCLUDING FILE LOSS OR CORRUPTION), ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.
